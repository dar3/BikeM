It's my first Android app made in **Android Studio** using **Java.** (Small project)

It was made to help people move across the city using public transport. Something like BusNavi, but with the bikes and some other new functions.

Not all buttons work, because i didn't receive all the information from transporting company.

In the future (when I will have more time :p) i am planning to improve it and make all of the buttons show proper information, so it's beta version.

You can see how it looks here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAgYVo15AMk
