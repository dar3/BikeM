It's my first Android app made in **Android Studio** using **Java.**

It was made to help people move across the city using public transport. Something like BusNavi, but with the bikes and some other new functions.

Not all buttons work, because i didn't receive all the information.

In the future i am planning to improve it and make all of the buttons to show proper information.
